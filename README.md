# go_resolve_hostname_cli

Command-line tool written in go to resolve a single hostname. This is my first (of many) tool written in go language. Feedback and PRs welcome. 


# Usage

First compile the tool: 
```
go build
```

Then run the tool with a DNS name argument: 
```
./go_resolve_hostname_cli --host www.google.com
```
